        /*
         * In Java, boolean is a separate data type.
         * It can store ONLY two possible values:
         *
         *      true  or  false
         *
         * Unlike languages like C/C++, Java does NOT allow:
         *      boolean a = 1;   // ❌ Not allowed
         *      boolean b = 0;   // ❌ Not allowed
         *
         * Because Java does NOT treat 1 as true or 0 as false.
         * Java is a strongly typed language, so boolean and int
         * are completely incompatible types.
         *
         * Even arithmetic operations on boolean are NOT allowed.
         * Example:
         *      a + b   // ❌ Invalid (boolean cannot participate in arithmetic)
         *
         * If needed, you must explicitly use true or false:
         *
         *      boolean a = true;
         *      boolean b = false;
         *
